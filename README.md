Smart Home System
Python(Flask)/HTML/JavaScript/Raspbian
• - I developed a SmartHome System using Raspberry PI 4 Model B and a set
of sensors (temperature/motion/humidity) . - Main languages used for this
project was Python. I used Python with Flask to craft a REST Api that I hosted
on my raspberry.
- Python server is the main orchestrator in this infrastructure that I designed. It
is the active component, that periodically checks for data from various sensors
that I installed around the house.
- HTML and CSS was used for the graphic interface. I created a webpage
where I could see various diagrams with the values recorded, and I could adjust room’s temperature or check for a history of the events that triggered the
motion sensor.
